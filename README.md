# API Project

### What is this?

This is one of my bachelor degree projects.
In my university there are three projects that contribute to my final score (up to 6 points).

This one in particular is the final project from the course 'Algoritmi E Principi Dell'Informatica' so the project is about programming and data structures.

Professor: Martinenghi Davide

**Score**: 30L/30

### Try it yourself!

If you want to try it yourself, I leave the [presentation](Presentation.pdf) and the [specification](Specification.pdf) files.

To get perfect score you need to run test case [111](Tests/open_111.txt) and have the ouput in under a second and with less than 78 MB of memory used.

### How to run tests

To run test on your code you need three simple steps (example with test 1):
1. Compile the program with the command `make your_c_file`
2. Run the program with the command `./your_c_file > output.txt < Tests/test_1.txt`
3. Check the difference between your `output.txt` and the test output `test_1.output.txt`
